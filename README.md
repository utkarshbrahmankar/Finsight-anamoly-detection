# FinSight – Financial Anomaly Detection System

FinSight is a machine learning-powered anomaly detection system built to identify irregular and potentially fraudulent transactions in large-scale consumer banking datasets.

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses unsupervised learning algorithms to detect unusual patterns in transaction data, with integrated logic for alerting and restrictions based on transaction types or countries. Visual dashboards assist in monitoring real-time anomalies.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects anomalies using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Transaction-based rule engine for country-specific restrictions
- Flask-based backend API for alerting and interfacing
- Visual dashboards for analysis using Tableau or Python plots
- Works with datasets containing 600K+ transaction records

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages/Libraries**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: Tableau / Matplotlib
- **Others**: Git, Jupyter
